                            The Muslim Students Association of Uganda adopted the concept of organising Annual Ramadhan Seminars in 2016 at various schools and mosques all over the country for Students, Muslim Women and general Muslims from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm.
                            The overall objective of these seminars is to Increase the love for Islam and appreciate the morals of Islam. The seminars are further organized to Underscore the need for Muslim Education, Elucidate the need for good child upbringing and to promote good moral conduct in society.
                            The program of the MSAU Ramadhan Seminars started in 2015 after the realizing the gap in knowledge among the Muslims who were living their own lives and practicing Islam their own ways. The gap of no seminars organized also contributed to the seminars.
