                            The (TOT) is program initiated in MSAU with the purpose of producing persons with competence in effectively addressing the critical issues that exist in our community. The society in which we live in is characterized by all sorts of problems, many of which are of management nature and can be addressed by an empowerment personality. Issues such as Poverty, Diseases, Wrangles, Water, Sanitation, Environment, Household income, Leadership, Education are very pertinent to the future of our country. We need to produce an individual with relevant skills and knowledge to live peacefully in his/her society when he/she is a solution to the community problems and not part of the problem. The youth must be development minded with ability to create jobs, co-exist well with others of different faiths and exhibit a high moral code of conduct in society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem seeks to give the student leaders and youths a mental challenge that will make them more creative thinkers and problem solvers. This way they will be able to go to the community and change the state of affairs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The program introduces participants to critical thinking, problem identification and analysis as well as coming up with relevant projects or programs that create a better and more peaceful world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of the program, participants are expected to have become resourceful persons who have ability to organize and conduct community programs with relevant approaches, messages and methodology to meet the training, development, as well as leadership needs of the community.
                        </p>
